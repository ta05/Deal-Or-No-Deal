## Description

We are creating a web application for a user to take part of a tv game show online. The user will be able to access the game simply by inputing their name and choosing a bitmoji. Once the game has begun, the user will choose 6 cases in the first round. then the banker will come up with an offer. User chooses Deal or No Deal, our game will help the user make this choice. The app will display statistics of the bankers deal and it will display red if it is a bad deal based on statistics and green if it is a good deal. This will continue until the game ends. This app is to assist players in making the right choice based on statistics instead of basing it off emotions.

## User Story

A web application that lets you take part of a famous tv game show that helps the user make informed decisions.
