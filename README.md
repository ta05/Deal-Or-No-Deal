## Description

We are creating a web application for a user to take part of a tv game show online. The user will be able to access the game simply by using google sign in(to save scores) or join as a guest. User will have the option to listen to music or not during the game. Once the game has begun, the user will choose 6 cases in the first round. The banker will then come up with an offer. User chooses Deal or No Deal, our game will help the user make this choice. The app will display statistics of the bankers deal and it will display red if it is a bad deal based on statistics and green if it is a good deal. This will continue until the game ends. This app is to assist players in making an informed decision while enjoying the game.
